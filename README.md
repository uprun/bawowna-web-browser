## Bawowna web browser

I am making this web browser from a scratch because:

I like dark theme and not all web-sites support it.

Second reason - there is not enough competition between browsers, 

I know it will be a long time before my browser will be comparible with currently available browsers, but you have to dream big.

Nothing is impossible.

I made basic display of Hacker News web-site in a week in a programming language I never used seriously before.

I know there is a lot of work to be done.

## made by Ukrainian.
